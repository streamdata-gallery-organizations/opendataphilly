description: OpenDataPhilly is a portal that provides access to over 175 data sets,
  applications, and APIs related to the Philadelphia region. Built by Azavea, a Philadelphia-based
  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software firm, it is now operated by the Philadelphia
  Public Interest Information Network, a Philadelphia-based non-profit organization.
  OpenDataPhilly is based on the idea that providing free and easy access to data
  information encourages better and more transparent government and a more engaged
  and knowledgeable citizenry.
